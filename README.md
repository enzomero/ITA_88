### Home task development.

_This is description of few main standards a home task solutions:_

* Each block of Tasks HAS TO do in a separate package, like `partX`.
* Each particular Task HAS TO have a number in the name which equals the number of tasks in the student's book,
  like `Task_X`.
* All extra files HAVE TO be placed in `src/main/resources/files`.
* Each extra file HAVE TO have name like `Task_X_extraY` and path `src/main/resources/files/partX/Task_X_extraY`
* All non-students book tasks HAVE TO be placed in `src/main/java/part_extra`.
* Any extra `class` or `interface` HAVE TO be placed in another package, like `.../partX/api/additional.java`
